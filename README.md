repo for smartwatch (unkown manufacturer)

I am editing the filesystem for a smartwatch my wife had bought me for an anniversary present. The device has no manufacturer's information in the box or on the device. It is a smartwatch with a compartment for sim card and sd card under the battery. The system icons it uses are from an early iphone, yet the filesystem is definitely android based. 

The boot partition is what is loaded when you plug the device into a computer. I have copied the contents and am analysing them and posting the files here on GitHub. Feel free to contribute, I hope to get my own full blown android running on here.
